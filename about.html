    <p>
      Hi im Kennadee. Just a girl with her stick who loves the captivating
      outdoors. Some describe me as a sunflower always turning and finding that
      ray of sunlight. In my off time I love to play pool, go swimming, camping,
      hang out with friends, and of course spend quality time with my family. I
      love capturing special moments in peoples lives with the a snap of a
      shutter. I have had a passion for photographing since I was ___ and
      couldn't be more happy. Let me help you freeze your favorite moments
      forever in time with a click of a stick.
