        Hi im Kennadee. Just a girl with her stick who loves the captivating
        outdoors. Some describe me as a sunflower always turning and finding
        that ray of sunlight. In my off time I love to play pool, go swimming,
        camping, and spending quality time with my friends and family. I love
        capturing special moments in peoples lives with the a snap of a shutter.
        I have had a passion for photography since I was 12, and couldn't be
        more happy. Let me help you freeze your favorite moments forever in time
        with a click of a stick :)
